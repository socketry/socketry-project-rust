# Set Up a Rust Repository

Use this skill to bootstrap a new Rust repository or add its initial shared Socketry tooling. For an audit of an established repository, use the `socketry-project-update` skill.

## Create the repository

Use a separate repository for a crate that needs its own version, release notes, or release tag. Use a Cargo workspace when its packages are meant to ship together at one version and share one `releases.md` and one `vVERSION` tag.

Choose the crate name for its public purpose. Crates.io has a flat package namespace, so use a `socketry-` prefix when needed to identify a Socketry crate. The repository can use the `-rust` suffix to distinguish it from a related project in another language.

Start with the standard Cargo layout and root files described in the Rust Repository Layout context guide provided by `socketry-project`. Keep the library's dependencies in the root package and development automation in a private `bake/` workspace member.

## Add shared project tasks

Install the Cargo launcher and bootstrap the private task package:

```sh
cargo install socketry-cargo-bake --locked
cargo bake --regenerate
```

The command creates `bake/`, adds it to the Cargo workspace, and writes a minimal binary. Let Cargo select the current dependency version:

```sh
cargo add --manifest-path bake/Cargo.toml socketry-project
```

In `bake/Cargo.toml`, prefix the version selected by Cargo with `>=` to make it an open-ended minimum. Keep that actual minimum in the manifest and the resolved version in `Cargo.lock`; the setup documentation does not need a copy of either version.

The open-ended minimum requirement allows newer `socketry-project` releases. The private Bake package's `Cargo.lock` records the selected version, so update the lockfile deliberately when adopting a newer release.

Run regeneration again to link its task registrations:

```sh
cargo bake --regenerate
```

Set release reviewers in the root `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[workspace.metadata.bake.release]
reviewers = ["socketry/managers"]
```

The `socketry-project` dependency makes the shared tasks available to the private Bake binary. It also registers `cargo:after_version_bump`, which updates `license.md`, `releases.md`, and generated sections in `readme.md` after a version change, then normalizes those files and every Markdown file under the public `context/` directory. Locally installed `.agents/context/` files are not included. Keep task tooling out of unrelated published libraries. Consumer projects should depend on `socketry-project` from their private `bake/` package.

## Agent context

Follow the [Agent Context section in `readme.md`](../readme.md#agent-context) to install and discover shared context and skills. Follow [Conventions](conventions.md#source-and-documentation) for where to keep package guidance and project-only instructions. The `bake-agent-context` guide documents installer behavior and options.

## Set up GitHub

Configure repository metadata, collaboration features, pull request defaults, and branch protection using the `socketry-project-github-repository` skill. Generate the Cargo workflow with `cargo:setup:workflow`; follow the `socketry-project-releasing` skill before applying rulesets, environment reviewers, or crates.io trusted publishing. It links to the Bake Cargo Readme for task-specific details.

## Test workflows

Use the `socketry-project-testing` skill for organization-wide testing expectations. Consult the installed `bake-test-rust` context for canonical `test.yml` and optional `external.yml` workflows, task setup, coverage options, and downstream test configuration.

Use `cargo bake cargo:setup:workflow` to generate `.github/workflows/publish.yml` from the canonical Bake Cargo template. The workflow runs `cargo:release:detect` and `cargo:release` for release checks, then `cargo:publish:pending` and `cargo:release:publish` after merge through the configured `crates-io` environment. The standard workflow is documented in the shared Releasing skill; its task binary must resolve `bake` 0.19.0, `bake-cargo` 0.4.0, and `bake-markdown` 0.3.0 or newer. Follow the `bake-test-rust` context for test workflow and task details.

## Work on the project

Keep the root `readme.md` concise and human-focused. Use the project context and Rust API documentation for detailed implementation guidance. Run the project's checks before opening a pull request, and update `releases.md` for user-visible changes.
