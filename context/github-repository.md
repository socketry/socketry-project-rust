# GitHub Repository Setup

Use these defaults when creating a Socketry repository. Preserve deliberate
project-specific settings when maintaining an existing repository.

## Repository metadata

- Use the canonical Socketry organization and project name.
- Write a short, accurate repository description.
- Set the homepage to the documentation site when one exists.
- Add focused topics for discovery; avoid repeating words already in the
  repository name.
- Use `main` as the default branch.

## Collaboration features

Enable Issues, Discussions, Pull Requests, Sponsorships, and repository
preservation. Disable Projects and Wiki unless the project has a concrete use
for them.

Use GitHub issue types consistently:

- `Bug` for defects and regressions.
- `Feature` for new user-facing capabilities.
- `Task` for maintenance, refactoring, documentation, tests, and release work.

Prefer organization or repository labels that already exist. Add labels only
when the project needs a reusable classification not covered by issue types or
existing labels. Do not repeat issue type information in issue or pull request
text when GitHub already records it as metadata.

## Pull requests and commits

- Disable merge commits; allow squash and rebase merging.
- Suggest updating pull request branches, allow auto-merge, and delete merged
  head branches automatically.
- Require contributors to sign off on commits made through GitHub's web
  interface.
- Allow comments on individual commits.
- Use Markdown, complete sentences, and a final period for pull request titles
  and commit messages.
- Keep most commit messages to one line. Start with what changed.
- Describe pull requests with a short summary followed by the problem and
  solution. Use GitHub issue type metadata instead of adding a separate change
  type section.

## Branch protection

Protect `main` and require pull requests with at least one approval. Allow
administrators to bypass these rules for maintenance. Require only stable
checks that are needed for safe auto-merge; do not make experimental,
informational, or unreliable coverage checks mandatory.

## Apply settings safely

Use the GitHub CLI for repository changes. Inspect the target first and always
use its full name in commands:

```sh
gh repo view socketry/PROJECT
```

When maintaining an existing repository, inspect its current settings and make
the smallest change that achieves the intended result. Preserve project-specific
settings. Do not rename, archive, transfer, or delete a repository without
explicit approval, and do not disable issues, pull requests, or required checks
without approval.

The Cargo-specific branch rulesets, crates.io environment reviewers, and
trusted-publishing setup are covered in the
[Cargo Publishing guide](https://github.com/socketry/bake-cargo-rust/blob/main/context/publishing.md).
