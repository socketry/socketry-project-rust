# `socketry-project`

Shared conventions and development tasks for Rust projects in the Socketry organization.

## Motivation

Rust projects should share a small set of clear conventions and a reliable release process without repeating task wiring in every repository.

## Usage

Install the launcher and create the private task package:

```sh
cargo install socketry-cargo-bake --locked
cargo bake --regenerate
```

Let Cargo select the current dependency version:

```sh
cargo add --manifest-path bake/Cargo.toml socketry-project
```

In `bake/Cargo.toml`, prefix the version selected by Cargo with `>=` to make it an open-ended minimum. Keep that actual minimum in the manifest and the resolved version in `Cargo.lock`; the setup documentation does not need a copy of either version.

Then run `cargo bake --regenerate` again to link the dependency's tasks. The command keeps generated links separate from task source, so no manual import in `main.rs` is needed. Run `cargo bake --list` to see the available tasks. The open-ended minimum requirement keeps this development dependency eligible for newer releases. `Cargo.lock` records the selected version for reproducible builds; update it deliberately when adopting a newer release.

This adds the standard Cargo, release, license, Readme, Markdown, agent-context, and testing tasks, including `test` and `test:external`. It also registers a version-bump hook that updates the project's standard files.

See the [repository setup skill](context/setup.md) for the minimal Cargo configuration and the [conventions](context/conventions.md) for repository layout, documentation, and code conventions. The [Rust Repository Layout](context/layout.md) explains source organization. The testing skill sets expectations and points to `bake-test-rust` for task and workflow details.

## Releasing

Prepare a release with `cargo bake cargo:version:patch` (or `minor`, `major`, or `bump --version X.Y.Z`), then run `cargo bake cargo:release` and open a pull request. After review and merge, GitHub Actions publishes the release when the configured `crates-io` environment approves it, then creates or updates the matching GitHub Release from `releases.md`. See the shared [Releasing skill](context/releasing.md) for the standard release process.

## Releases

<!-- bake-readme:releases:start -->

See [releases.md](releases.md) for the full release history.

### v0.3.13

- Use named references between skills and agent context so guidance remains usable after installation.

### v0.3.11

- Document how to maintain dependency versions in installation examples and compatibility guidance, using manifests and lockfiles as authoritative sources.
- Replace duplicated release-tooling version lists with guidance for checking the resolved provider's manifest.

### v0.3.10

- Add independent adversarial review guidance, with local iteration until all non-trivial issues are resolved before opening a pull request.
- Clarify that the private Bake package shares the workspace's root lockfile.

### Agent Context

Run `cargo bake agent:context:install` to install shared context and skills. Read `.agents/context/index.md` to find relevant guides, follow `agents.md` if present, and apply skills under `.agents/skills/`. The installer preserves repository-owned `agents.md`; it does not create or regenerate that file.
